Python Reprojector Documentation
================================

This is a simple python library for coordinate transformations between
different projections. It uses the `pyproj
library <https://github.com/jswhit/pyproj>`__ as a wrapper for
`proj.4 <https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4>`__. The goal is to make
transformations as simple as possible.
